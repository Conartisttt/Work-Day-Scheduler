# Work-Day-Scheduler

## Description

The purpose of this application is to allow employees to save events for each hour of the day using a simple calendar interface so that they can manage their time effectively. In this project, starter code was provided, and I have updated this starter code to meet the criteria in the features section.

* **The final result can be found here:** [Work Day Scheduler](https://conartisttt.github.io/Work-Day-Scheduler/)

## Features

* The current day is displayed at the top of the planner
* When you scroll down, there are timeblocks with standard business hours
* Timeblocks are color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
* When a timeblock is clicked, an event can be entered
* When the save button is clicked, the event is saved in local storage
* When the page is refreshed, the events persist
* Uses a date utility library to work with date and time

* **The following image shows a demonstration of the web applications appearance and functionality:**
